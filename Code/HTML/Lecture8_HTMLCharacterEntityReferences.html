            It doesn't quite understand what kind of a tag that

            bracket and just says the word more.

        &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
        or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually 
        in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who 
        comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does 
        actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself
        in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the 
        worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
        cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;

                    but they will not be separated anymore
