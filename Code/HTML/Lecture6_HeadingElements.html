<!--Semantic: Relating to meaning in language or logic
    Semantic html element: Element that implies some meaning to the content
        Human and/or machine can understand meaning of content surrounded by a semantic element better
        May help search engine ranking, i.e., SEO search engine optimization
    Heading elements:
        h1 ,... h6: increase importing
        These elements are only meant to convey structure of your HTML page, nothing more.
        Second, something that's marked h1 is obviously the most important and generalized description of the content of this page.
    All tag in code: block-level elements
    Summary:
        Well chosen content of H1 element is crucial to SEO
        Semantic elements allow for a more meaningful expression of the structure of our HTML page
