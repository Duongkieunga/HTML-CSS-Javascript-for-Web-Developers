<!-- The term content model refers to the full behavior the browser applies to 
    the elements belonging to that content model, and to the nesting rules of those elements 
    HTML5 split these two content models into seven models.
    two traditional models: Either block level elements or inline elements
        block-level element:the browser will automatically place that element on a new line in the flow of the document. 
            You could change that with CSS
            May contain inline or other block-level elements within them.
            Roughly Flow Content (HTML5 category)
        inline elements: render on the same line by default. 
            May only contain other inline elements
